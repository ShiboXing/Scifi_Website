                                    The Zone was full of unspeakable horrors that killed off those who had previously lived in the area and continuously threatened lives of others who lived nearby. Stalker and a group of men traveled The Zone in hopes of finding the golden ball that could grant them there wildest dreams and wishes. 
                                    Many feared what was left in The Zone by an alien race who discarded these dangerous technologies not considering the effects they would have on the neighboring society. Once the men finally found the room, after a long and treacherous journey, they fought about the dangers and none asked any the ball to grant any of there wishes but instead simply left making the entire trip a waste of time.
