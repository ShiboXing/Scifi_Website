                                Much of the movie was filmed in Mexico City and at Estudios Churubusco. Director, Paul Verhoeven, used subway stations and metal buildings making Total Recall truly look futuristic while being budget friendly. 
                                <br><br>Instead of creating structures from scratch pre existing buildings were used and played a great role in the movie allowing the director to put financing elsewhere. Using the cities natural landscape perfectly blended in with the films theme where the rocky and red landscape of Mars had to be created.

                            Much of Stalker was shot in black and white but final scene of Monkey and the zone used bold colors of green and red. Before entering The Zone everything pictured is very monochromatic as if there was mildew or film covering the camera.
                            Throughout the film long shots were used to show the full bodies of each character and the surrounding imagery of the mysterious zone. Music added suspense to the movie, when they first entered the zone the repetitive noise of the wagon along with strange mechanical or alien noises. Low tones allow the audience to look out for conflicts or danger to suddenly appear on screen.
