                                Society on the moon depends on these forms of technology and impacts everyone even low culture. Technology was also used to alter individuals thoughts changing who they were and how they operated, in turn the outcome of technology formed who they were. 
                                <br>Technology separates masses, those with access to technology form the upper class while those in the subdominant groups are controlled by this same technology (such as air reactors). On earth tech plays apart to the non-essentials such as virtual memories, exactly opposite on mars where everyone is more concerned on how to survive.

                                Technology is used differently depending on individual characters as well as when on earth compared to Mars. Doug showed many doubts about the use of technology like memory distortion, but these questions did not kill his desire to try out a virtual vacation. 
                                <br>Doug understood that with any form of tech comes complications such as the possibility of losing touch with reality. Doug thought that shifting his own memory find him solace from the memories of the burnette that plagued him every night, later in the movie Quaid no longer found peace within technology but instead found trouble.

                                The characters within the movie did not have names but only professions, many of which were centered around the gathering or examining of technology. Stalker’s entire life was based around getting these “artifacts” from the zone and was the way he supported his family. 
                                <br>The professor fears this type of technology and wants to destroy the room because he is afraid with how it will affect society. The writer does not want to accumulate these forbidden artifacts and is not afraid of them but instead hopes to gain a sense of inspiration from the zone and all the strange technological commodities found within.

                        <br>Similar to many other sci-fi films technology Stalker completely changes the lives of those who come in contact with it. Due to the aftermath of an extraterrestrial incident citizens live in fear of the technology left behind due to the power and destructive nature of these objects. 
                        <br><br><br>This technology, known as artifacts, were half hazardously discarded by an unknown alien race who left with no regard to how their actions would plague Canada.
